# One Instruction Set Computer VM and Compiler

This is a VM and assembler for an experimental [One Instruction Set Computer][oisc]. 

We implemented this for a Computer Architecture course final project back in 2005
with my good friend Adem Kader.
Not included in this project but there was also a VHDL based hardware implementation
of the OISC processor that ran on an [FPGA][].

Adem still hosts [the write up we did for this on his site.][writeup]
