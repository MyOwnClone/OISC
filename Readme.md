# One Instruction Set Computer VM and Compiler

This is a VM and assembler for an experimental [One Instruction Set Computer][oisc]. 

We implemented this for a Computer Architecture course final project back in 2005
with my good friend Adem Kader. It's one of the first significant chunks of Java
I've written so you'll notice some peculiarities in terms of style.
Not included in this project, there was also a VHDL based hardware implementation
of the OISC processor that ran on an [FPGA][].

Adem still hosts [the write up we did for this on his site.][writeup]
